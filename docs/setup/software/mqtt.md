title: "MQTT"
---

The Battery-Emulator is compatible with MQTT. It can be configured to publish data to your MQTT broker and then be used in whatever way you choose (like for example [Home Assistant](home_assistant.md)). You can modify the Battery-Emulator code to publish more data, less data, or other data, as well as subscribing to MQTT topics. There are also advanced functions that can be triggered via MQTT, such as charge limits.

The main purpose of this implementation is better integration with popular home automation platforms such as Home Assistant, in order to (for example) keep track of battery temperature and cell deviation. If "MQTT" and "Home Assistant" are not familiar words, you will likely not benefit from this until you're up to speed on the current state of home automation.

!!! note "NOTE"
    The MQTT topic name, the Home Assistant object-ID prefix, the HA device name, and the HA device identifier are no longer independently configurable settings. All four are automatically set to the device's **hostname**, which itself defaults to `battery-emulator-xxxx` (`xxxx` being the last two bytes of the device's MAC address) unless a custom hostname has been set on the Connectivity settings page. The examples on this page use `battery-emulator-a1b2` as a stand-in for this value - substitute your device's actual hostname wherever you see it.

!!! note "NOTE"
    This page documents the MQTT implementation as found in `Software/src/devboard/mqtt/mqtt.cpp`. The behaviour described here matches recent builds. Older releases behave differently - see [Migrating from older releases](#migrating-from-older-releases).

## Enabling MQTT

To start using MQTT, enable the **Enable MQTT** checkbox under the Integration settings in the Web UI. The remaining MQTT fields only appear once that box is ticked.

| Setting | Range / default | Meaning |
| ------- | --------------- | ------- |
| **MQTT server** | hostname or IP | Broker address (plain TCP; TLS is not implemented) |
| **MQTT port** | 1–65535, default `1883` | Broker port |
| **MQTT user** / **MQTT password** | printable ASCII | Credentials; leaving the password field blank keeps the stored one |
| **MQTT timeout ms** | 1–60000, default `2000` | Network timeout of the underlying esp-mqtt client |
| **MQTT publish interval (seconds)** | 1–300, default `5` | Main publish cadence (see [Published data](#published-data)) |
| **Send all cellvoltages via MQTT** | off | Enables the `spec_data*` topics |
| **Publish heap metric diagnostics** | off | Adds four heap sensors to `/info` and to autodiscovery |
| **Allow remote BMS reset via MQTT** | off | Gates the `BMSRESET` command |
| **Home Assistant autodiscovery** | off | Publishes retained HA discovery configs |
| **Autodiscovery topic** | default `homeassistant` | Base topic for discovery messages |
| **Publish at firmware updates** | off | Publish the discovery configs whenever a firmware update is detected |
| **Publish at next boot** | off | Publish the discovery configs at next boot (unticks automatically) |

The device's **Hostname** field (set in the Network config section) determines the MQTT topic name, the HA object-ID prefix, the HA device name, and the HA device identifier - see the note at the top of this page.

!!! note "NOTE"
    The publish interval is applied when the MQTT client is started, and the heap-metrics checkbox changes which sensors are auto-discovered. Both take effect **after a restart**.

!!! note "NOTE"
    Make sure that your LAN is not on `192.168.4.x`, since this conflicts with the built-in ESP access point!

## Published data

Out of the box, the implementation publishes the following topics. All topics are prefixed with the device's topic name (its hostname), shown here as `battery-emulator-a1b2`.

| Topic | Contents | Retained |
| ----- | -------- | -------- |
| `battery-emulator-a1b2/status` | Availability string (`online` / `offline`) | Yes (both values) |
| `battery-emulator-a1b2/info` | System/emulator status + battery #1 state JSON | No |
| `battery-emulator-a1b2/info_2` | Battery #2 state JSON (double-battery setups) | No |
| `battery-emulator-a1b2/info_3` | Battery #3 state JSON (triple-battery setups) | No |
| `battery-emulator-a1b2/info_multi` | The combined battery - every pack as one - JSON (double/triple setups only) | No |
| `battery-emulator-a1b2/spec_data` | All cell voltages and per-cell balancing status (when enabled) | No |
| `battery-emulator-a1b2/spec_data_2` | Battery #2 cell voltages and per-cell balancing status (when enabled) | No |
| `battery-emulator-a1b2/spec_data_3` | Battery #3 cell voltages and per-cell balancing status (when enabled) | No |
| `battery-emulator-a1b2/events` | Battery-Emulator events | No |

When a **second battery** is configured, its values are published to its **own topic** `.../info_2`, using the **same key names** as battery #1 (`SOC`, `battery_voltage`, …, without any suffix), and its cell data goes to `.../spec_data_2`. A **third battery**, on compatible integrations, follows the same pattern with `.../info_3` and `.../spec_data_3`. The global emulator values (`bms_status`, `pause_status`, `event_level`, `emulator_status`, `hardware`, `software_version`, `cpu_temp`, `emulator_uptime`, `heap_*`) are only present on `.../info`.

With more than one battery configured, a further topic `.../info_multi` carries the **combined battery** - what the inverter is actually given. See [The combined battery](#the-combined-battery) below. It uses the same key names again, so a template written against `.../info` reads the combined topic unchanged.

Two publish cadences are used:

- The **main interval** is the configurable **MQTT publish interval** (default **5 s**) and covers `events` and all `info` topics. On each cycle the order is: `events` → `info` → `info_multi` → `info_2` → `info_3`.
- **Cell data** (`spec_data*`) is published on a fixed **60-second** cadence, independent of the main interval. Cell voltages change slowly, and these are by far the largest payloads.

Publishing is skipped entirely while an **OTA update** is in progress, so a firmware upload is not competing with MQTT traffic.

Values are only published once **valid data** exists. Battery values appear only after the battery has actually been seen on CAN (not merely expected), CAN sending is allowed, and the post-boot startup delay has passed. Individual values that arrive later - such as `total_capacity` on batteries that derive it from received data, `insulation_resistance`, or `charged_energy`/`discharged_energy` - are omitted from the JSON until they are known. In Home Assistant this shows as **"unknown"** rather than a false `0` (or a false default like `370.0 V`) during boot.

**`<hostname>/info` (and `/info_2`, `/info_3`)**

`.../info` holds the system/emulator status plus battery #1's state. `.../info_2` and `.../info_3` hold only the respective battery's state, with identical key names. Numeric scaling notes:

- All voltages (`battery_voltage`, `cell_min_voltage`, `cell_max_voltage`) are published in **volts** as floats.
- `cell_voltage_delta` is the raw difference and is published in **millivolts**.
- `battery_current` is in amperes, power values in watts, energy/capacity values in watt-hours.
- `insulation_resistance` is in **kΩ**.
- `bmwi3_pack_resistance_mohm` is in **mΩ**.
- Temperatures are in °C. `cpu_temp` is published as a float (display precision is suggested to HA as 1 decimal).
- Heap values are in **bytes**, `heap_fragmentation` in percent.
- ESPNow running status in `espnow_running`, `1` = running, `0` = not running.

Example payload (single battery), published to `battery-emulator-a1b2/info`:

```json
{
  "bms_status": "ACTIVE",
  "pause_status": "RUNNING",
  "SOC": 63.30,
  "SOC_real": 61.05,
  "state_of_health": 92.00,
  "temperature_min": 5.8,
  "temperature_max": 7.4,
  "stat_batt_power": -1450.0,
  "battery_current": -3.5,
  "battery_voltage": 386.4,
  "cell_max_voltage": 3.787,
  "cell_min_voltage": 3.765,
  "cell_voltage_delta": 22.0,
  "total_capacity": 75000.0,
  "remaining_capacity_real": 45780.0,
  "remaining_capacity": 47475.0,
  "max_discharge_power": 30000.0,
  "max_charge_power": 12000.0,
  "balancing_active_cells": 0,
  "balancing_status": "Ready",
  "charging_state": "Discharging",
  "limiting_factor": "Battery",
  "event_level": "INFO",
  "emulator_status": "RUNNING",
  "hardware": "Waveshare ESP32-S3 RS485 CAN",
  "software_version": "11.2.dev",
  "cpu_temp": 41.3,
  "emulator_uptime": 10001,
  "espnow_running": 1
}
```

Keys appear conditionally:

- All battery values - only once the battery has been detected on CAN, is still communicating, CAN sending is allowed and the board has finished booting. Before that, `.../info` contains only the global emulator values.
- `total_capacity` - only once known (non-zero); some battery integrations derive it from received data.
- `charged_energy` / `discharged_energy` - only on batteries that support charged-energy tracking, and only once both totals are non-zero. Each battery reports **its own** totals.
- `cell_max_voltage` / `cell_min_voltage` / `cell_voltage_delta` - only once per-cell voltages have been populated.
- `insulation_resistance` - only on batteries that report insulation resistance, and only once a valid sample has been decoded.
- `cpu_temp` - only when **Measure CPU temperature** is enabled in the settings.
- `heap_free`, `heap_max_block`, `heap_min_free`, `heap_fragmentation` - only when **Publish heap metric diagnostics** is enabled.
- `dc_dc_current` / `dc_dc_voltage` - only for Tesla Model 3/Y and Model S/X.
- `autocal_taper`, `autocal_dwell_s`, `autocal_cooldown_ready`, `autocal_soc_drift`, `min_cell_number`, `max_cell_number` - only for the BYD Atto 3.
- `leaf_hx` - only for the Nissan Leaf, and only once a battery-group reply with a known layout has been decoded.
- `bmwi3_pack_resistance_mohm`, `bmwi3_soc_havrla`, `bmwi3_soc_havrla_mode` - only for the BMW i3 ([SOC Havrla](../../battery/bmw_i3.md#soc-havrla-voltage-based-soc)), and not on the LilyGo T-CAN485 or the ESP32 DevKit.
- `SOC`, `remaining_capacity` and `limiting_factor` - **only in single-battery setups**. See [What changes on the per-battery topics](#what-changes-on-the-per-battery-topics) below.

**Status strings**

`balancing_status` is one of: `Unknown`, `Error`, `Ready`, `Active`, `Pending`. `Pending` means cells are flagged for balancing but the BMS is not bleeding them yet.

`charging_state` is one of: `Idle`, `Charging`, `Discharging` (derived from the sign of the battery current).

`limiting_factor` tells you what is currently capping the allowed power in the active direction: `Inverter`, `UserSetting`, `Battery`, or `Idle` when the battery is neither charging nor discharging.

**Heap metric diagnostics**

When enabled, four internal-RAM heap values are added to `.../info`, using the same sources and fragmentation formula as the ESPHome debug component, so they are directly comparable with an ESPHome node's:

```json
{
  "heap_free": 157284,
  "heap_max_block": 110592,
  "heap_min_free": 141020,
  "heap_fragmentation": 29.7
}
```

`heap_fragmentation` is the share of the free heap that is not reachable as one contiguous block. It is omitted rather than published as `NaN` if the free heap ever reads zero.

### The combined battery

In a [double](battery_2x.md) or [triple](battery_3x.md) battery setup, the individual packs are combined into a single virtual battery, and that is the only thing the inverter ever sees. `.../info_multi` publishes that combined view.

This topic exists **only when more than one battery is configured**. With a single pack the battery *is* the installation, so `.../info` already carries these values and a second topic would only duplicate them.

Key names match the per-battery topics wherever the meaning is the same, so a `value_template` written against `.../info` works unchanged here. Three keys exist only on this topic, because there is no per-battery equivalent:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | ------- |
| `total_capacity_scaled` | Combined total capacity after the SOC window |
| `max_charge_current` | Charge current limit given to the inverter, in amperes |
| `max_discharge_current` | Discharge current limit given to the inverter, in amperes |

Example payload for two Nissan LEAF packs (21.8 kWh + 17.9 kWh), published to `battery-emulator-a1b2/info_multi`:

```json
{
  "SOC": 40.32,
  "SOC_real": 40.23,
  "state_of_health": 62.09,
  "battery_voltage": 386.0,
  "battery_current": 3.0,
  "stat_batt_power": 1158.0,
  "total_capacity": 39700.0,
  "total_capacity_scaled": 27790.0,
  "remaining_capacity_real": 15972.0,
  "remaining_capacity": 11204.0,
  "max_discharge_power": 6700.0,
  "max_charge_power": 6700.0,
  "max_discharge_current": 19.0,
  "max_charge_current": 19.0,
  "cell_max_voltage": 3.695,
  "cell_min_voltage": 3.639,
  "temperature_max": 22.0,
  "temperature_min": 21.0,
  "charging_state": "Charging",
  "limiting_factor": "UserSetting"
}
```

How each value is combined is documented on the [Double Battery](battery_2x.md) page. In short: capacities, current, power and lifetime energy add up; SOC follows the emptiest pack; state of health follows the weakest; cell voltages and temperatures are the extremes across the packs; and the **power limits are the lowest any pack allows, not the sum**.

`charged_energy` and `discharged_energy` appear only if at least one configured pack tracks lifetime energy. Most integrations - the Nissan LEAF among them - do not, in which case both keys are absent from this topic.

There is no `cell_voltage_delta`, `balancing_*`, `insulation_resistance` or battery-specific key on this topic. Those describe a physical pack, not the installation, and stay on the per-battery topics.

#### What changes on the per-battery topics

Once a second battery is configured, three keys leave the per-battery topics, and two change meaning:

| Key | Single battery | Two or three batteries |
| --- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| `SOC` | Present (SOC-window scaled) | **Absent** - use `SOC_real` per pack, or `SOC` on `info_multi` |
| `remaining_capacity` | Present (scaled) | **Absent** - use `remaining_capacity_real` per pack, or `remaining_capacity` on `info_multi` |
| `limiting_factor` | Present | **Absent** - published on `info_multi` |
| `max_charge_power` / `max_discharge_power` | What the inverter is allowed | What **that pack's BMS** asked for |
| `charging_state` | Present | Present - each pack reports its own direction |

The reasoning:

- **The SOC window belongs to the installation.** A scaled percentage only means something for the system as a whole, so with several packs the scaling is applied once, on `info_multi`, and each pack publishes real, unscaled figures. `SOC` and `remaining_capacity` would otherwise just repeat `SOC_real` and `remaining_capacity_real`.
- **`limiting_factor` is one answer for the system.** It describes what is capping the inverter, which is not a property of any single pack - published per pack it was the same string repeated on every topic.
- **`charging_state` genuinely is per pack.** Parallel packs at slightly different state of charge push current into each other, so one pack can briefly show `Charging` while another shows `Discharging`.
- **Per-pack power limits are now the BMS's own request.** A pack's limit is reshaped by the safety layer, the SOC taper and the inverter filter before the inverter sees it, and for pack #1 that made `max_charge_power` the whole system's decision while packs #2 and #3 reported raw BMS values - three different kinds of number under one key. Each pack now reports what its own BMS asked for; the system's limits are on `info_multi`.

**`<hostname>/spec_data`**

Published only when **Send all cellvoltages via MQTT** is enabled, and only on battery implementations that report per-cell voltages. Published every **60 seconds** (see above). Cell voltages are in **volts** as floats; the per-cell balancing status is included in the same message.

```json
{
  "cell_voltages": [3.779, 3.780, 3.782, 3.767, 3.783, 3.769, 3.782, 3.768],
  "cell_balancing": [true, true, false, false, false, false, false, true]
}
```

The two arrays always have the same length and describe the same snapshot: element *N* of `cell_balancing` is the balancing state of the cell whose voltage is element *N* of `cell_voltages`. The `cell_voltages` key is **absent** until the BMS has actually filled the voltages in, so the very first messages after boot may contain only `cell_balancing`.

The whole message must fit the 4 KB MQTT message buffer. If a pack has so many cells that the payload would overflow it, the message is skipped (with `Cell data MQTT msg too large for buffer` in the log) rather than truncated, and the rest of the publish cycle continues normally.

**`<hostname>/events`**

One message is published per new, not-yet-published event, in ascending timestamp order. All values are strings.

```json
{
  "event_type": "RESET_SW",
  "severity": "INFO",
  "count": "1",
  "data": "3",
  "message": "Info: The board was reset via software, webserver or OTA. Normal operation",
  "millis": "10001"
}
```

**`<hostname>/status` (availability / LWT)**

A plain-text availability topic (not JSON), following the standard MQTT Last-Will pattern:

- `online` is published **once, retained**, each time the device connects to the broker.
- `offline` is registered as the broker's Last Will and Testament (QoS 1, **retained**), so the broker publishes it automatically if the connection drops unexpectedly.

Because both values are retained, any subscriber (including Home Assistant after a restart) immediately receives the current availability without waiting for the next publish. The MQTT keepalive is set to 30 seconds, so after a sudden failure (power loss, Wi-Fi drop) the broker marks the device `offline` within roughly 45 seconds.

This topic is referenced by the `availability` block of every Home Assistant discovery message.

### Connection robustness

A few implementation details are worth knowing if you are debugging a flaky broker or a weak Wi-Fi link:

- **Publishes use QoS 0**; the command subscription uses QoS 1.
- The esp-mqtt **outbox is capped at 16 KB**. Queued traffic that cannot reach the broker fails to enqueue instead of growing on the heap until the device runs out of memory.
- **A failed publish is logged once per outage.** The first failure of an outage produces a `... MQTT msg could not be sent` line; the message is not repeated every cycle until a complete publish cycle has succeeded again.
- The MQTT client id is `BatteryEmulatorClient-<hostname>`.

## Subscriptions

The Battery-Emulator subscribes to `<hostname>/command/+`, e.g. `battery-emulator-a1b2/command/+` (subscription QoS 1).

The currently supported commands are:

- `BMSRESET` - Triggers a hardware power-cycle of the BMS. **Only acted upon if remote BMS reset is enabled** (see [Remote trigger through MQTT](../hardware/periodic_bms_reset.md#remote-trigger-through-mqtt)); otherwise the message is ignored.
- `PAUSE` - Triggers the pause feature
- `RESUME` - Resumes from the paused state, and clears an equipment stop, allowing contactors to re-close (see [Opening and closing contactors](#opening-and-closing-contactors-stop-and-pause-vs-resume))
- `RESTART` - Restarts the Battery-Emulator (pauses, then reboots the board after a short delay)
- `STOP` - Triggers the equipment stop (opens contactors); see [Opening and closing contactors](#opening-and-closing-contactors-stop-and-pause-vs-resume)
- `SET_SCALESOC` - Sets SOC scaling limits at runtime
- `SET_LIMITS` - Sets a temporary charge and/or discharge limit
- `ESPNOW_RUN` - Runtime control of [ESPNow](espnow.md) (payload `1` = start, `0` = stop).
- `SET_BMWI3_SOCHAVR` - Sets the BMW i3 SOC Havrla mode; see [Setting the BMW i3 SOC Havrla mode](#setting-the-bmw-i3-soc-havrla-mode)

For example: `battery-emulator-a1b2/command/PAUSE`

### Opening and closing contactors (`STOP` and `PAUSE` vs. `RESUME`)

The auto-discovered button labelled **"Open Contactors"** is the `STOP` command. There is **no separate "Close Contactors" command or button** - closing the contactors is exposed through MQTT as the `RESUME` command (the auto-discovered "Resume charge/discharge" button). The naming is asymmetric, which is why it can look as though closing is missing: `STOP` is named after its contactor effect, while its inverse `RESUME` is named after its pause effect.

Under the hood, `STOP` latches an equipment-stop state, and `RESUME` clears it:

- `STOP` sets the equipment-stop flag, which forces the contactor state machine open and prevents it from re-closing.
- `RESUME` clears the equipment-stop flag, which allows the contactor state machine to run through precharge and close again.

So the effective mapping is:

| Command | Effect on contactors | HA button label |
| ------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| `STOP`   | Opens (sets equipment stop) | Open Contactors |
| `RESUME` | Closes (clears equipment stop) | Resume charge/discharge |

Two things to keep in mind:

- `RESUME` *allows* the contactors to close; it does not *force* them closed. They only actually close if the inverter also permits closing and the normal preconditions are met (battery detected, past the post-boot startup delay, no faults). If the inverter is what is holding the contactors open, `RESUME` will not override that.
- `RESUME` does double duty - it both ends a `PAUSE` and clears an equipment stop. There is no command that closes the contactors without also resuming charge/discharge, just as `STOP` cannot open them without also pausing.

### SET_SCALESOC

Sets the **runtime** SOC scaling limits (the max and/or min percentage used by "Rescale SOC"). The change is not saved to flash, so a reboot restores the saved values. It only has an effect when "Rescale SOC" is enabled; otherwise the command is ignored.

Limits are set in percent, e.g. `90.0` = 90.0 %.

| Parameter | Data type | Accepted range | Default          |
| --------- | --------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| `max_pct` | number    | 50.0 to 100.0  | keep current max |
| `min_pct` | number    | -10.0 to 50.0  | keep current min |

If `max_pct` or `min_pct` is omitted, the corresponding limit is left unchanged. A value outside the accepted range is ignored and a warning is logged.

Example payload (max 90.0 %, min 10.0 %), published to `battery-emulator-a1b2/command/SET_SCALESOC`:

```json
{
  "max_pct": 90.0,
  "min_pct": 10.0
}
```

Use case for this is to increase the usable SOC window during winter or when weather is worse and charging is slower, decrease it during summer when charge is faster - all these to increase battery lifespan, but still be able to max out the battery capacity when it's really needed - automated by an external system.

### SET_LIMITS

Sets a **temporary** charge and/or discharge current limit for `timeout` seconds. While the limit is active it overrides the manual (user-set) limit in settings.

Limits are set as deciampere, i.e. `300` = 30.0 A.

| Parameter      | Data type | Default       |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `max_charge`    | number    | disable limit |
| `max_discharge` | number    | disable limit |
| `timeout`       | seconds   | 30            |

If `max_charge` or `max_discharge` is omitted (or not an integer), the corresponding limit is disabled. If `timeout` is omitted, it defaults to 30 seconds.

Example payload (max charge 30 A, max discharge 40 A, timeout 60 seconds), published to `battery-emulator-a1b2/command/SET_LIMITS`:

```json
{
  "max_charge": 300,
  "max_discharge": 400,
  "timeout": 60
}
```

#### How the limit is applied and expires

- **Temporary by design.** The main loop checks every cycle whether `now > (timestamp_of_last_command + timeout)`. Once that is true, the remote limit flags are cleared and the remote values are zeroed, so the limit must be **re-sent before each timeout** to stay in effect.
- **Not persisted.** The remote limit is never written to flash, so it is also cleared by a reboot. After power-on no remote limit is active until a new `SET_LIMITS` is received.
- **Reverts to the manual/BMS limit, not to "unrestricted".** When the remote limit expires, the allowed current falls back to the manual (user-set) limit, or to the BMS/inverter-derived limit if no manual limit applies.
- **Overrides rather than combines with the manual limit.** While a remote limit is active, the manual user limit is bypassed - the remote value is used instead. The remote limit can therefore sit *above* your manual limit during the active window. It still only ever *lowers* the BMS/inverter-derived allowed current (it caps, it cannot raise the battery's own limit).
- **Applies to the installation, not to a single pack.** In a double or triple setup the limit caps the combined battery, which is what the inverter is given. It shows up as `max_charge_current` / `max_discharge_current` on `info_multi`, with `limiting_factor` reading `UserSetting`.

To cancel a limit quickly, send a new message with a short timeout (for instance `1` second). 

### Starting and stopping ESPNow

Being able to start and stop [ESPNow](espnow.md) at runtime remotely lets an automation turn telemetry on only when a receiver needs it. Since it's intended to be used on a display, which likely most of the time is not being actively watched, might not even be turned on, it's beneficial to have a way to only turn on radio broadcast when it's actually needed. Keeping [ESPNow](espnow.md) off when not used reduces ESP32 temperature, radio interference, power consumption and increases cybersecurity.

Use command `ESPNOW_RUN` with payload `1` to start and `0` to stop ESPNow. To see the current status, watch topic `info/espnow_running`, where the same values reflect the running status.

### Setting the BMW i3 SOC Havrla mode

`SET_BMWI3_SOCHAVR` changes the [SOC Havrla](../../battery/bmw_i3.md#soc-havrla-voltage-based-soc) setting of a BMW i3, the same setting as on the webserver's Settings page. The payload is the mode:

| Payload | Mode |
| ------- | ---- |
| `0` or `disable` | Use the SOC from the BMS |
| `1` or `auto` | Use SOC Havrla if it differs from the BMS SOC by more than 3 percentage points |
| `2` or `enable` | Always use SOC Havrla |

Unlike `SET_LIMITS`, the mode is **stored in flash**, so it survives a reboot. An invalid payload is ignored and logged. The current mode is published as `bmwi3_soc_havrla_mode` (`Disabled`, `Auto` or `Enabled`) on the `info` topic.

The command, and the SOC Havrla values on the `info` topic, are not available on the LilyGo T-CAN485 and the ESP32 DevKit.

## Home Assistant Discovery

When [Home Assistant](home_assistant.md) auto-discovery is enabled, the device publishes retained configuration topics so entities are created automatically. Discovery topics are published under the configurable **Home Assistant auto discovery topic** (default `homeassistant`); the entity/object portion and the device identity are both derived from the device's hostname.

All discovery payloads share a common block:

```json
{
  "device": {
    "identifiers": ["battery-emulator-a1b2"],
    "model": "Battery Emulator",
    "manufacturer": "FOSS",
    "name": "battery-emulator-a1b2",
    "hw_version": "Waveshare ESP32-S3 RS485 CAN",
    "sw_version": "11.2.dev",
    "configuration_url": "http://192.168.1.50"
  },
  "availability": [{ "topic": "battery-emulator-a1b2/status" }],
  "payload_available": "online",
  "payload_not_available": "offline",
  "enabled_by_default": true
}
```

`manufacturer` and `model` are fixed values; `identifiers` and `name` are the device's hostname, so each Battery-Emulator on the network appears as its own distinct HA device as long as each has a unique hostname (the default, MAC-based hostname already guarantees this). `hw_version` is the board name, `sw_version` the running firmware version, and `configuration_url` links straight to the device's Web UI from the Home Assistant device page.

The full set of auto-discovered sensors is generated from the battery, combined-battery and global templates.

**Per battery:** `SoC (scaled)`, `SoC (real)`, `State of Health`, `Temperature Min/Max`, `Battery Power`, `Battery Current`, `Cell Max/Min Voltage`, `Cell Voltage Delta`, `Battery Voltage`, `Total Capacity`, `Remaining Capacity (scaled)` and `(real)`, `Max Charge/Discharge Power`, `Battery Charged/Discharged Energy`, `Insulation Resistance`, `Balancing Cells`, `Balancing Status`, `Charging State`, `Limiting Factor`, plus the battery-specific `DC-DC Current/Voltage` (Tesla), the `BYD Auto-cal` set and `Min/Max Cell Number` (BYD Atto 3), and `Hx` (Nissan Leaf).

**Combined battery (double/triple setups only):** `SoC (scaled)`, `SoC (real)`, `State of Health`, `Battery Voltage`, `Battery Current`, `Battery Power`, `Total Capacity (real)` and `(scaled)`, `Remaining Capacity (real)` and `(scaled)`, `Max Charge/Discharge Power`, `Max Charge/Discharge Current`, `Cell Max/Min Voltage`, `Temperature Min/Max`, `Charging State`, `Limiting Factor`, and `Battery Charged/Discharged Energy` where at least one pack tracks them.

**Emulator-level (diagnostic):** `BMS Status`, `Pause Status`, `Event Level`, `Emulator Status`, `Emulator Uptime`, `Emulator Version`, `CPU Temperature`, `Event`, and - when enabled - `Heap Free`, `Heap Max Block`, `Heap Min Free`, `Heap Fragmentation`. These are published with `"entity_category": "diagnostic"`, so Home Assistant files them under the device's Diagnostic section instead of the main sensor list. The **Reboot Emulator** button is a diagnostic entity too.

With a second (or third) battery, each battery sensor is duplicated with a ` 2` (or ` 3`) name suffix and a `_2` (`_3`) suffix on its `unique_id` and object ID; its `state_topic` points at `.../info_2` (`.../info_3`), and its `value_template` uses the plain, un-suffixed key.

### Naming in multi-battery setups

Once more than one battery is configured the naming shifts, so that the unqualified name always means the installation:

| | Name | `unique_id` / object ID | `state_topic` |
| --- | ---- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Combined battery | `SoC (scaled)` | `..._SOC_multi` | `.../info_multi` |
| Battery #1 | `SoC (scaled) 1` | `..._SOC` | `.../info` |
| Battery #2 | `SoC (scaled) 2` | `..._SOC_2` | `.../info_2` |
| Battery #3 | `SoC (scaled) 3` | `..._SOC_3` | `.../info_3` |

Battery #1's entities gain a ` 1` in their **display name only**. Their `unique_id` and object ID stay un-suffixed, so existing Home Assistant entities keep their identity and their history - nothing is orphaned by adding a second pack.

!!! note "NOTE"
    Home Assistant only picks up the new display name if you have not renamed the entity yourself. Any custom friendly name set in the UI is kept, and will not show the ` 1`.

!!! note "NOTE"
    The combined-battery entities are new entities with new `unique_id`s, so they start with fresh history. If you remove a second battery later they stop updating and go *unavailable* rather than disappearing - delete them from the Home Assistant entity list to clean up.

### Sensor discovery

Topic: `<discovery topic>/sensor/<hostname>/<entity_id>/config` (battery 2/3 sensors use the `_2`/`_3`-suffixed entity id in the topic, e.g. `.../SOC_2/config`; combined-battery sensors use `_multi`, e.g. `.../SOC_multi/config`).

Example (`homeassistant/sensor/battery-emulator-a1b2/SOC/config`):

```json
{
  "name": "SoC (scaled)",
  "state_topic": "battery-emulator-a1b2/info",
  "unique_id": "battery-emulator-a1b2_SOC",
  "default_entity_id": "sensor.battery-emulator-a1b2_SOC",
  "value_template": "{{ value_json.SOC | default(none) }}",
  "unit_of_measurement": "%",
  "device_class": "battery",
  "state_class": "measurement",
  "suggested_display_precision": 1,
  "device": { "identifiers": ["battery-emulator-a1b2"], "model": "Battery Emulator", "manufacturer": "FOSS", "name": "battery-emulator-a1b2", "hw_version": "Waveshare ESP32-S3 RS485 CAN", "sw_version": "11.2.dev", "configuration_url": "http://192.168.1.50" },
  "availability": [{ "topic": "battery-emulator-a1b2/status" }],
  "payload_available": "online",
  "payload_not_available": "offline",
  "enabled_by_default": true
}
```

The same sensor for a second battery (`.../SOC_2/config`) differs only in: `"name": "SoC (scaled) 2"`, `"unique_id": "battery-emulator-a1b2_SOC_2"`, `"default_entity_id": "sensor.battery-emulator-a1b2_SOC_2"`, and `"state_topic": "battery-emulator-a1b2/info_2"` - the `value_template` stays `{{ value_json.SOC | default(none) }}`. The combined-battery sensor (`.../SOC_multi/config`) follows the same pattern with `_multi` and `.../info_multi`, and keeps the plain name `"SoC (scaled)"`.

#### How the discovery payload is built

- **`value_template` uses `| default(none)`.** Keys that are legitimately absent (a battery that has not been detected yet, a capacity that is not known yet) therefore land in Home Assistant as *unknown* instead of raising a template error on every message.
- **`state_class`** is set to `measurement` for every sensor that has a `device_class`. The numeric sensors that deliberately have no `device_class` - `balancing_active_cells`, `insulation_resistance`, `bmwi3_pack_resistance_mohm`, `leaf_hx`, `heap_fragmentation` - get `measurement` explicitly.
- **Capacity sensors use `device_class: energy_storage`**, not `energy`. Home Assistant rejects `energy` combined with `state_class: measurement`, and `total_capacity*` / `remaining_capacity*` represent a currently stored amount rather than a running total.
- **`charged_energy` / `discharged_energy` keep `device_class: energy`** but use `state_class: total_increasing`, since they are genuine lifetime counters.
- **`suggested_display_precision`** is set to 3 for cell min/max voltage, 2 for `leaf_hx`, 1 for battery current, CPU temperature, both SoC sensors and heap fragmentation, and 0 for insulation resistance and the BMW i3 pack resistance. It is deliberately not applied to `battery_voltage`.
- **MDI icons** are assigned centrally: by entity for the status-like sensors (`mdi:fuel-cell` for the balancing pair, `mdi:information-box-outline` for BMS status, `mdi:resistor` for insulation and the BMW i3 pack resistance, `mdi:battery-heart-variant` for Hx, `mdi:home-battery` / `mdi:home-battery-outline` for charging state and limiting factor, `mdi:information-outline` for emulator status / event level, `mdi:battery-outline` for pause status, `mdi:tag-outline` for the version, `mdi:memory` for the heap sensors), and by device class for the rest (`mdi:current-dc` for voltage, `mdi:equal` for current).

### Cell-voltage discovery

Topic: `<discovery topic>/sensor/<hostname>/cell_voltage<N>/config` (second battery uses a `_2_` suffix in the topic, third battery `_3_`).

Example (`homeassistant/sensor/battery-emulator-a1b2/cell_voltage96/config`):

```json
{
  "name": "Battery Cell Voltage 96",
  "default_entity_id": "sensor.battery-emulator-a1b2_battery_voltage_cell96",
  "unique_id": "battery-emulator-a1b2battery-emulator-a1b2__battery_voltage_cell96",
  "device_class": "voltage",
  "state_class": "measurement",
  "state_topic": "battery-emulator-a1b2/spec_data",
  "unit_of_measurement": "V",
  "suggested_display_precision": 3,
  "icon": "mdi:current-dc",
  "value_template": "{{ value_json.cell_voltages[95] }}",
  "device": { "identifiers": ["battery-emulator-a1b2"], "model": "Battery Emulator", "manufacturer": "FOSS", "name": "battery-emulator-a1b2", "hw_version": "Waveshare ESP32-S3 RS485 CAN", "sw_version": "11.2.dev", "configuration_url": "http://192.168.1.50" },
  "availability": [{ "topic": "battery-emulator-a1b2/status" }],
  "payload_available": "online",
  "payload_not_available": "offline",
  "enabled_by_default": true
}
```

Cell-voltage entities update every 60 seconds, matching the `spec_data` publish cadence.

Cell-voltage discovery is **retried until the cell count is known**. A battery that has not yet reported how many cells it has does not block the rest of the discovery pack - the per-cell configs are simply published on a later cycle, once the count arrives.

There are no combined-battery cell-voltage entities. Cells belong to a physical pack, so each pack keeps its own.

### Event discovery

Topic: `<discovery topic>/sensor/<hostname>/event/config`

```json
{
  "name": "Event",
  "state_topic": "battery-emulator-a1b2/events",
  "unique_id": "battery-emulator-a1b2_event",
  "default_entity_id": "sensor.battery-emulator-a1b2_event",
  "value_template": "{{ value_json.event_type ~ ' (c:' ~ value_json.count ~ ',m:' ~ value_json.millis ~ ') ' ~ value_json.message }}",
  "json_attributes_topic": "battery-emulator-a1b2/events",
  "json_attributes_template": "{{ value_json | tojson }}",
  "icon": "mdi:information-outline",
  "entity_category": "diagnostic",
  "device": { "identifiers": ["battery-emulator-a1b2"], "model": "Battery Emulator", "manufacturer": "FOSS", "name": "battery-emulator-a1b2", "hw_version": "Waveshare ESP32-S3 RS485 CAN", "sw_version": "11.2.dev", "configuration_url": "http://192.168.1.50" },
  "availability": [{ "topic": "battery-emulator-a1b2/status" }],
  "payload_available": "online",
  "payload_not_available": "offline",
  "enabled_by_default": true
}
```

### Button (command) discovery

In addition to sensors, Home Assistant **Button** entities are auto-discovered for the supported commands, so they can be triggered from the HA dashboard. These are published once on MQTT connect, and only marked as done once *all* of them went out - a mid-list failure is retried on the next connect rather than leaving the remaining buttons undiscovered.

Topic: `<discovery topic>/button/<hostname>/<command>/config`

| Button | Command | Icon | Action |
| ------ | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| Reset BMS | `BMSRESET` | `mdi:star-four-points-box-outline` | Triggers the BMS reset feature (only if remote BMS reset is enabled) |
| Pause charge/discharge | `PAUSE` | `mdi:battery-minus-outline` | Triggers the pause feature |
| Resume charge/discharge | `RESUME` | `mdi:battery-sync-outline` | Resumes from the paused state |
| Reboot Emulator | `RESTART` | `mdi:restart` | Restarts the Battery-Emulator (diagnostic entity) |
| Open Contactors | `STOP` | `mdi:battery-remove-outline` | Triggers the stop feature |

## Running multiple Battery Emulators on one broker

Multiple Battery Emulators can share the same MQTT broker, and they separate themselves automatically: the MQTT topic name, the HA object-ID prefix, the HA device name, and the HA device identifier all default to the device's hostname, which itself defaults to `battery-emulator-a1b2` (`a1b2` being the last two bytes of the device's MAC address) - making it unique out of the box without any manual configuration. If you'd prefer a friendlier name, set a custom hostname on the Connectivity settings page; just make sure each device on the same broker gets a different one.

## Migrating from older releases

Recent builds changed the MQTT layout in several ways that affect anyone consuming the raw topics (manually configured `mqtt:` sensors, Node-RED flows, Telegraf, custom scripts). **Home Assistant auto-discovery users are migrated automatically** - the discovery configs are updated and all `unique_id`s are preserved, so existing entities keep their history and no duplicates appear. Some entity *display names* changed (`SOC (Scaled)` → `SoC (scaled)`, `Stat Batt Power` → `Battery Power`, `State Of Health` → `State of Health`, the `RESTART` button → `Reboot Emulator`); any custom name you set in Home Assistant is untouched.

- **Battery 2/3 moved to their own topics.** Previously, a second/third battery's values were added to `.../info` with suffixed keys (`SOC_2`, `battery_voltage_3`, …). They are now published to `.../info_2` and `.../info_3` using the same plain key names as battery #1. Update raw consumers to subscribe to the per-battery topic and drop the key suffix.
- **`balancing_data*` topics were removed.** The per-cell balancing arrays are now part of the `spec_data*` messages, under the `cell_balancing` key. Update raw consumers to read `cell_balancing` from `.../spec_data` (or `.../spec_data_2` / `_3`).
- **`balancing_status` no longer reports `Blocked`.** That state is now published as `Pending`. Any automation matching on the literal string needs updating.
- **The discovery prefix is configurable.** It still defaults to `homeassistant`, so nothing changes unless you set the new **Home Assistant auto discovery topic** field.
- **Several emulator-level entities became diagnostic.** They still exist with the same `unique_id`, but Home Assistant now lists them under the device's Diagnostic section.

### Double and triple battery setups

These changes affect multi-battery installations only. Single-battery setups are unaffected throughout.

- **`.../info_multi` is new.** It carries the combined battery, which is what the inverter is given. Anything that previously read system-wide values off `.../info` should read them here instead.
- **`SOC` and `remaining_capacity` left the per-battery topics.** The SOC window is applied to the installation, not to each pack, so the packs publish real figures only. Use `SOC_real` / `remaining_capacity_real` per pack, or the scaled values on `.../info_multi`.
- **`limiting_factor` moved to `.../info_multi`.** It describes the inverter's limit, which is one answer for the whole system. `charging_state` stays on each pack.
- **`max_charge_power` / `max_discharge_power` now mean that pack's own BMS request.** Previously battery #1 reported the system's decision here while batteries #2 and #3 reported raw BMS values. For the limit the inverter is actually given, use `.../info_multi`.
- **Battery #1's entity display names gained a ` 1`.** Identifiers are unchanged, so no entity is orphaned.

!!! note "NOTE"
    Cell data now updates every 60 seconds rather than at the main publish interval, and battery values are omitted from the JSON until real data has been received from the battery - consumers must tolerate absent keys rather than assuming every key is present in every message.
