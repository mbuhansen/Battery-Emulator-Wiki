## Word of caution when buying i3 batteries ⚠️

!!! info "IMPORTANT"
    The BMS (SME) inside the i3 battery will store crash data. If the battery comes from a really hard crash that triggered enough airbags, there is a possibility that the SME has entered a locked state, and will never engage the contactors. The only way to unlock the battery is with an expensive BMW tool called "EoS Tester" that costs 10k€. **Update:** According to a user you can swap the SME board with one from eBay or other places online and it will work with battery emulator, though not with a BMW i3 since it will need to be EoS tested.

!!! warning "CAUTION"
    When shutting down a working i3 battery system, no load can be present on the HV circuit. First shut down inverter before shutting off the battery, OR use the PAUSE button in the Webserver to ensure that 0A of current before shutting down the battery. The i3 has extremely sensitive welding detection. If there is over a few A of current during opening of contactors, it will set the "Contactors Welded" state and lock the battery permanently.

The EoS tester can be rented from some places, a great i3 expert is available in CZ, [i3upgrade](https://www.i3upgrade.cz/)
Another alternative when dealing with a locked battery, is to open up the battery and bypass the contactors. Nobody has reported if this works yet (feel free to edit this wiki!), worst case you could also replace the i3 BMS with an [RJXZS](bms/rjxzs_bms.md)

An indicator if the battery is not in lock state is the range indicator of the crashed car. If it displays battery range/percentage, the battery is *probably* not in lock state even if a few airbags have gone off.

### SOC Havrla (voltage-based SOC)
The SOC reported by the i3 BMS can drift a long way from the real state of charge, especially if the battery is not balanced regularly. SOC Havrla is an alternative SOC that the Battery-Emulator calculates itself from the cell voltages. It is selected with the **SOC Havrla** setting, which is shown on the Settings page when "BMW i3" is the selected battery:

| Mode | What the emulator reports as SOC |
| ---- | -------------------------------- |
| **Disable (use BMS SOC)** | The SOC from the BMS, as before. This is the default. |
| **Auto (use Havrla if >3% difference)** | The BMS SOC, unless SOC Havrla differs from it by more than 3 percentage points. Then SOC Havrla is used. |
| **Enable (always use Havrla)** | Always SOC Havrla. |

How it is calculated:

- Above an average cell voltage of 3.8 V the highest cell voltage is used, below it the lowest. A full pack is then judged by its highest cell, and an empty pack by its lowest.
- The cell voltage is corrected for the voltage drop over the pack's internal resistance at the present current. Charging raises the measured voltage, so the correction is subtracted while charging and added while discharging. Over the last 0.5 % near empty and near full the correction is faded out.
- The emulator estimates the internal resistance itself. When the current steps by at least 1 A, it compares the voltage before the step with the voltage 1 s after it, and then waits 5 s before the next measurement. Results outside 5-500 mΩ are ignored. The estimate starts at 80 mΩ and every measurement only moves it a little, so it settles over many load changes.
- The corrected voltage is looked up in a voltage/SOC table for the detected pack size (60, 94 or 120 Ah).
- Smoothing: when the result is within 5 percentage points of the SOC shown, the shown SOC moves at most 1 % per minute. It does not move against the current, so it does not rise while discharging or fall while charging (above 1 A). Bigger differences, for example right after start-up, are followed faster.

When the setting is on **Auto** or **Enable**, the emulator also does the following. On **Disable** the BMW i3 behaves as before.

- The SOC is sent to the inverter in whole percent, with 1 % hysteresis so it does not flip between two values. For example, 100 % is only shown once SOC Havrla reaches 100.00 %, and it stays at 100 % until SOC Havrla has dropped to 99.00 %.
- Extra charge and discharge current limits close to full and close to empty. They can only lower the limits that the BMS sends, never raise them. A limit is tightened right away, but it is only released again by 1 A per minute (2 A per minute for discharge on the 120 Ah pack).

| Pack | Charge limit (highest cell) | Discharge limit (lowest cell) |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 60 Ah | 15 A at the 97 % cell voltage, down to 1 A at 99.8 % | 30 A at the 12 % cell voltage, down to 1 A at 10 % |
| 94 Ah | 25 A at the 97.5 % cell voltage, down to 1 A at 99.8 % | 30 A at the 11 % cell voltage, down to 3 A at 9 % |
| 120 Ah | 30 A at the 98 % cell voltage, down to 1 A at 99.8 % | 30 A at the 11 % cell voltage, down to 1 A at 5 % |

The cell voltages are taken from the voltage/SOC table of the detected pack. For a 60 Ah pack, for example, the charge current is limited from a highest cell of 4.068 V and is down to 1 A at 4.083 V. The current then stays at about 1 A until the pack is full, which gives a short settling phase before balancing. On top of that, charging is limited from 30 A at 98.0 % SOC Havrla down to 1 A at 99.8 %, on all pack sizes.

Both values are shown on the **More Battery Info** page as "Internal resistance" and "SOC Havrla". Even with the setting on Disable, you can compare them with the BMS SOC there before you switch modes.

!!! note "NOTE"
    SOC Havrla is not available on the LilyGo T-CAN485 and the ESP32 DevKit, as these boards don't have the flash space for it. On those boards the BMS SOC is always used.

## Connection diagram

### High voltage connector
Right beside the HV connector there is a plug with 2 small pins, these need to be bridged either with the original plug, or shorted with a jumper for the battery to be able to turn on (Interlock detection)

[![](../images/bmw-i3-03.png){ width="300" }](../images/bmw-i3-03.png)

![image](../images/bmw-i3-04.png){ width="550" height="726" }

### High voltage connector (E196*1B)
* Pin 1 = HV+
* Pin 2 = HV-
The HV connector has + and - marked on it.

#### HVIL part of high voltage connector (E196*01B)
* Pin 1 HVIL (loop to 2)
* Pin 2 HVIL (loop to 1)
Can also be bridged with jumper wires.

!!! tip "TIP"
    Check out our [High Voltage wiring](../setup/hardware/wiring_tips_hv.md) page with examples on how to make the connections safely.

### Low voltage connector (A191*1B)
The LV connector is located on the back of the battery pack, next to the A/C cooling port. A/C connector is not required for operation.

[![](../images/bmw-i3-14.png){ width="300" }](../images/bmw-i3-14.png)

It has the following pinout:

[![](../images/bmw-i3-15.png){ width="500" }](../images/bmw-i3-15.png)

Connect the wiring as follow:

* Pin 1 30C - Connect to 12V, 10A fuse optional
* Pin 9 15WUP-Signal (Green/GreenRed) - Connect to 12V, 5A fuse optional. Control this pin with ASR-10DD relay or a Pololu Power Switch controlled by the WUP GPIO pin of your board (see the list below).
* Pin 7 (Red) - Connect to 12V, 5A fuse optional
* Pin 2 Ground (BrownBlack) - Connect to Ground
* Pin 4 CAN-H (WhiteYellow) - Connect to CAN-H on the board - twist with CAN-L cable and put a 120Ω resistor across to CAN-L.
* PIN 10 CAN-L (WhiteBlue) - Connect to CAN-L on the board
* Pin 6 I_LOCK (BlueRed) (connect to Pin 12 with a 33Ω resistor in between)
* Pin 12 I_LOCK (BlueRed) (connect to Pin 6 with a 33Ω resistor in between)
* Pin 3 Refrigerant valve (NOT USED)
* Pin 8 Refrigerant valve (NOT USED)

#### 15WUP-Signal

The GPIO that controls the WUP signal depends on your BE hardware:

- LilyGo T-CAN485: GPIO 25 (For double bat GPIO 32 is used for secondary BMW i3 battery)
- Stark CMR: GPIO 25 (For double bat GPIO 32 is used for secondary BMW i3 battery)
- LilyGo T-2CAN: GPIO 40 (For double bat GPIO 38 is used for secondary BMW i3 battery) 
-Since a recent update WUP has been moved to GPIO 1! This requires you to buy qwic wires or jst sh 1.0. These can be found on Amazon or AliExpress with a few cm or wire crimped to them.

The wakeup signal needs to be actuated by the Battery-Emulator, and as soon as messages start to come through from the battery we reply. This ensures a reliable startup. Same goes for rebooting/shutting down the battery. The Battery-Emulator sets WUP to low incase we need to command the BMS off.

Since the board has 3.3V logic on the GPIO pins, we need to use a solid state relay in order to boost the 3.3V -> 12V. Example connection using 1x ASR-10DD solid state relay:

!!! warning "CAUTION"
    To avoid [welded contacts](#CAUTIONCONTACTORSWELDED) Ensure you have a 12V backup system to avoid unwanted contact closings under load in case of a blackout.

### Note on capacitor
Capacitors are high voltage, so they need to be inside an IP enclosure to prevent anyone from touching or water getting onto it and shorting it out. Most either mount the capacitor next to the battery, or next to the inverter, at either end of the HV bus. The most popular solution is to install fuses and the capacitor right at the start where HV comes out of the battery, sort of an add-on box that gets mounted on the original HV cable coming out of the battery. This is also a good place to step down the batteries thick DC cabling (35mm² in case of the i3), down to a more manageable 10mm². Check out our [High Voltage wiring](../setup/hardware/wiring_tips_hv.md) page with examples on how to make the connections safely.

Example of capacitor integrated at point where wire gauge is reduced, inside exclosure:

### Note on Balancing :b: 
The BMW i3 battery needs periodic cell-balancing to be able to operate at full capacity. To start this balancing procedure, charge the battery to 100%, and go to the "More Battery Info" page on the Webserver. There is a button called "Start balancing". When balancing is started via this page, the battery will power off the wakeup(WUP) pin towards the battery, stop CAN communication, and the battery can then start to balance, just as it would in a car.

Perform this balancing as often as necessary to keep cell mV delta low. Failure to balance will longterm lead to much capacity being unavailable due to voltage diff, along with wildly incorrect SOC% readings.

## Important info when used with BYD CAN inverter
!!! note "NOTE"
    If you intend on using BYD-CAN with the BMW i3, the battery needs to be on a separate CAN bus. The BMW i3 is using the same CAN IDs as BYD do, so if you try to run them both on the same bus the IDs will collide and values get interpreted wrong.

## Troubleshooting tips

| Problem | Suggested fix |
| :-----: | :---: |
| Contactors not closing | Check that the capacitor is seated between HV+ and HV-. Check that negative and positive are not accidentally shorted together. Worst case scenario HV fuse inside battery is blown and requires replacing |
| Event "Error: Battery interlock loop broken. Check that high voltage / low voltage connectors are seated"  | Check that both interlocks are OK. 1. The High Voltage needs to have the two small HVIL wires joined together near the orange connector. 2. The Low Voltage connector also needs to have pin 6 and 12 connected via a 33 Ohm resistor. If you are doing the pins yourself, make sure they are seated all the way. |
